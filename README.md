## Conways Game of Life

## Description

This is a recreation of Conway's game of life. A cellular automation created by mathematician John Conway.
Its evolution is determined by its initial state of alive and dead cells.
With every generation each cell will count how many neighbors it has and by following a simple set of rules it will either survive to the next generation or die.

## Rules

1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
2. Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.
